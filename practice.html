    <h1>Introduction to C++, Installing VS Code, g++ & more | C++ Tutorials for Beginners #1</h1>
    <p>In these C++ tutorials, we are going to learn about the C++ programming language from the very basics to the industry level. This course has been designed in a way to nurture the beginners setting their feet in this discipline. So tighten your belts,
        and enjoy the ride! Before starting, let me explain to you the difference between this and any other source for learning C++: This is a whole complete package in itself, covering from A to Z of the language. No redundancy and monotonicity. Beginner
        friendly, hence easy to learn. No prerequisite, just a zeal for learning. To start with, I’ll be covering these things in today’s tutorial: What is programming and why C++? Installation of Visual Studio Code Installation of g++ Writing our first
        program and executing it.</p>
    <h1>What is programming, programming language, and why C++?</h1>
    <p>Programming can be understood as your instructions to the computer(machine) to solve real problems. The very basic principle of creating machines was to make life simpler and machines, on our instructions, have been able to do the same. But the distance
        between what we say and what the machine understands gets abridged by a programming language. This marks the importance of learning a programming language. A programming language helps us communicate with the computer. Analogous to us humans,
        who need some language, be it English, Hindi, or Bangla, to talk to our people, computers too need a language to converse. Just to name a few, there is C++, C, Python, Java, etc. Now when we start listing the names of these programming languages,
        the question which instinctively arises is why C++. Despite this being an 80s programming language, it never lost its sheen. C++ was an added version of C developed by Bjarne Stroustrup. It is believed to be very close to the hardware making it
        comparatively easy for programmers to give the instructions directly to the system without any intermediary. Another reason for C++ to be one of the most used languages is its object-orientedness. C++ is an object-oriented programming language
        giving it the power to create real-world software systems. You don’t have to worry much about these terms, which believe me, only sound complex and ain’t really! Just sit back and dive with me in this plethora of knowledge.</p>
